# nomenclature

*Its not really complicated to run the code, just use the nomenclature.py file (it does not need any additional files to run) 
*The goal is to name basic organic molecules based off user input from simple questions
*ideally, whoever would be running this code would have basic knowledge of structural details
  some things to know:
    a parent chain is the longest chain of carbons in a molecule  
    in a line structure, each end of a line represents a carbon, and the line is the bond itself. ( if this were a molecule: - it would consist of 2 carbons)
    when numbering those places on a chain for substituents and bonds, alcohols (OH groups) have highest priority, and should be at the lowest number on the chain. followed by triple bonds, double bonds, and if there are only alkyl groups and halogens present, ordering is by alphabetical order
